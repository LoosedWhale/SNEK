# SNEK
## Describtion 

This is a snake game that I call **SNEK**. \
SNEK was created as a fun side project which ended up getting me into OOP.

ClassSnek.py is the latest version. \
There will be menues added to that version. \
That includes rewriteing of the program so that is uses OOP in a better way. 

## How to install & use 
> python -m pygame venv venv \
> venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 \
> pip install pygame \
> python .\ClassSnek.py 

> Alternativly if you have pygame installed \
> Simply run it as normal  

### Note

###### The code will be updated for grapics and menus soon™️.
###### When the game is done it will be easier to run and it will include major upgrades from its current form.
