# SNEK
A snake game made to learn OOP in python 

*Not really* there is 3 versions of this snake game that I have called Snek
ClassSnek.py being the latest version.
SnekShared is the version that is being worked on by my classmates and myself.
Note that the code will be updated for grapics and menus soon.

The game is using pygame but I could not figure out how to share that file due to it being to large.
