# SNEK
## Describtion 

This is a snake game that I call **SNEK**. \
SNEK was created as a fun side project which ended up getting me into OOP.

ClassSnek.py is the latest version. \
There will be menus added to that version. \
That includes rewriting the program, so that is uses OOP in a better way. 

Made with python and pygame \
